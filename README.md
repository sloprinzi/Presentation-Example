Presentation Example: Gender and Ages of Refugees 
================

## The UNHCR

Welcome to my presentation page! This presentation was created for my Data Analysis course in Spring 2023 to look at the data on refugee genders and ages from the top five countries that refugees come from. The graphs in this presentation look specifically at the Syrian Refugee population in 2019, and then the refugee population from the top five countries during 2019 and 2021 (before and after the beginning of the COVID pandemic).

In particular, this presentation was created to "people" the data, including the [70,000 children that are born as stateless people](https://www.unhcr.org/ibelong/the-urgent-need-to-end-childhood-statelessness/#:~:text=With%20a%20stateless%20child%20being,being%20born%20stateless%20are%20severe.) every year. As you go through the presentation, each slide will have detailed explanations of what the data and graphs are telling us. Whatâ€™s most important is to look at is the side by side comparison of refugee ages and genders. Bringing light to how many women and children are stateless from place like Syria, Venezuela, Ukraine, Afghanistan, and South Sudan.

### The data


This data comes from the United Nation's High Commissioner for Refugees [Refugee Data Finder](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/download/?url=AkSU25) which is publically accessible.  If you would like to recreate the graphs from my presentation, please see the `index.rmd` file above in addition to the dataset I worked with from the UNCHR titled `editeddemographics.xlsx`.
