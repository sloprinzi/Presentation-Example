Presentation Example: Gender and Ages of Refugees 
================

## Why this data?

Welcome to my presentation page! This presentation was created for my Data Analysis course in Spring 2023 to look at the data on refugee genders and ages from the top five countries that refugees come from. The graphs in this presentation look specifically at the Syrian Refugee population in 2019, and then the refugee population from the top five countries during 2019 and 2021 (before and after the beginning of the COVID pandemic).

In particular, this presentation was created to "people" the data, including the [70,000 children that are born as stateless people](https://www.unhcr.org/ibelong/the-urgent-need-to-end-childhood-statelessness/#:~:text=With%20a%20stateless%20child%20being,being%20born%20stateless%20are%20severe.) every year.
