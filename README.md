# Presentation 
Example output from original coding 



This is an example of a slide deck I created as part of a project for a Data Analysis course in Spring 2023. The assignment asked us to collect data and blah blah blah.

My project looks at the relationship between these things and those other things. I gathered data from wherever___ and I did A, B, and C to clean it.


Files for the project: 
- `mydata.csv` replication data
-  `slidescript.Rmd` code for creating the slides
- `index.html` with the output 

see the slides at URL. 


We need to upload a file called `index.html` (my poster/codebook/slide deck as an html file). You take the file in Rmd format. MAY ONLY BE CALLED INDEX.HTML


You can view the output here: _____ [at this link](html......).
